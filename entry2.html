    <div class="h2">A little-known fact about me is that I have an intense fear of revolving doors. It's irrational, 
        but every time I go through one <br> I envision myself getting trapped. We don't have this in the suburbs! Even in Seattle proper the 
        revolving doors are few and far between. <br> This phobia presented a real issue though...it seems like every goddamn door here is a
    revolving one. How is that fair?? I needed some <br> exposure therapy, <i>STAT.</i></div>
