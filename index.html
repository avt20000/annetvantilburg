    <div class="h1"><i>Hi, welcome to my NEW new website...</i></div>
    
    <div class="h2">On August 18th, 2023, I moved from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkland,_Washington target="_blank">here</a> 
        to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_East_Side" target="_blank">here</a> for college. I'm from a small suburb near Seattle, 
        Washington, and the transition was more drastic than I was prepared for. 
        It was a big move, and I didn't know anyone on the East Coast. I didn't even know anything <i>ABOUT</i> the East Coast. 
        During this time I experienced several instances of culture shock, cuz it's just so different from where I came from. 
        I wasn't <br> expecting it at all, but there it was. </div>
    <div class="h3">I guess you could call this my <i>East Coast Culture Shock.</i> </div>
